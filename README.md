# Haven Releases

The releases repo allows users to download their desired OS product without having to trust havenprotocol.org. This repo allows users to cross reference a number of  downloadable product sources to verify the integrity of the file downloads. This creates a more vigilant security process.

# Download Sources

- Website: https://havenprotocol.org/products
- Github: https://github.com/haven-protocol-org/haven-releases
- Discord: https://discord.gg/haven

For Discord, you will need to first join Discord and then navigate to the #links channel. Discord invites are created from the .gg domain not the .com domain.

For security concious users, simply verify that the SHA's of all three download sources are exactly the same. If you notice any differences **please contact us via Discord** immediately.
